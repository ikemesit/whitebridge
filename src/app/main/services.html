          <h4>HR Structuring / Restructuring </h4>
          <p>Entrepreneurs are usually only concerned with other factors of production and their business interest, ignoring the personnel aspect. They are mostly unconcerned about how people are sourced, managed and maintained for the survival and growth of the business.</p>
          <p>Human resource structuring is the process of setting up structures and control measures for people management in an organization. It involves developing policies, procedures and processes that would be used to acquire, reward, maintain, retain and exit an organization’s most valuable asset – <strong>PEOPLE</strong>.<p>
          <p>At Whitebridge, we help new and existing businesses develop structures that are individually applicable yet fit international best practices.</p>

          <h4>Recruitment &amp; Placement Services</h4>
          <p>An organization is only as good as the personnel working therein; therefore the quality of personnel working in an organization determines its output and achievements. Knowing this, Whitebridge ensures that round pegs are put in round holes in every of its recruitment engagement. Recruitment refers to the process of attracting, screening, selecting, placement and on-boarding a qualified person for a job.</p>

          <p>With proper job analysis and specification, we are sure to give to an organization only the best people to work for them and at competitive industry remuneration. We are aware that if we get it right at the recruitment level, every other function of human resources will run smoothly. It was Maurice McDonald, a co-founder of McDonald Corporation who dropped this timeless business fact, <em>“you are only as good as the people you hire”</em>. Let’s make you good with the right people.</p>

              <p>The practice of Human Resource is constantly evolving in line with trends and organizational demands. Hence, the function hitherto known as Training is now mostly referred to as Training and Development, and of recent, Learning and Development. This is because human resource practitioners don’t just seek to train employees but to ensure they learn and develop in line with their job functions or challenges.</p>
              <p>As a Human Resource consulting firm, we will be rendering the service of learning and development to our client with the sole objective of adding value to their bottom line. We have respectable and experienced resource persons that are made up of seasoned professionals to deliver well-articulated learning and development demands in a most friendly and relaxed environment using modern and adequate facilities.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>At Whitebridge, we do not  just jump into Learning and Development contract with a client, we will be sure to conduct a Learning and Development Need Analysis to ensure vacuums are identified which our Learning and Development  process will fill so as to be able to measure the Learning and Development impact on employees and organizations overtime.</p>

          <h4>Manpower Planning &amp; Auditing</h4>
          <p>Failing to plan is planning to fail.  As simple as that sounds, it applies to every facet of life. So any organization that does not plan its manpower is on a faulty foundation. Manpower Audit is a function that seeks to point out loopholes in practices and policies of HR and recommend suggestions for improvement. Whitebridge Consulting renders the Manpower Planning function to start-ups and established organizations, and renders the Manpower Audit service to large scale and public sector organizations. We realize the fact that an organization is only as effective as its workforce and as such, we will plan the manpower towards greater output for clients without compromising standards. </p>

          <h4>Employee Performance Management</h4>
          <p>Every organization has its set goals and objectives which they expect their employees to assist in meeting. Often times, these goals are not met and the organization may want to know the reason(s). Hence, Performance Management is a human resource function that seeks to continually appraise, monitor and improve employee’s performance in line with organizational goals. The needs for uninfluenced and unbiased opinion/report are some of the reasons why strategic firms outsource this function.</p>

          <p>In undertaking this function, our focus is always on improved productivity and increased profitability with the aid of improved performance by employees. The growth of an organization depends largely on the efficiency of its employees.</p>
